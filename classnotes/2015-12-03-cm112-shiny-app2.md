- [activity "Building Shiny apps" continued](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/shiny01_activity.html)

## Shiny apps continued ...
- `reactive({...})` - to assign a reactive variable
- `observe({...})` - to access a reactive variable

- Share your shiny app!
    1. host on http://www.shinyapps.io -> up to 5 FREE shiny apps
    2. host your own shiny server

- Shiny in R markdown
    - Don't know if it works on shinyapps.io
```

```

- [Stop reactions with `isolate()`](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/isolation.html)
    - e.g. `islate(data <- rnorm(input$num))`
- global.R - objects here are available to both ui.R and server.R
- `DT::dataTableOutput()` / `tableOutput()` -- make table looks nicer
- `navbarPage()` or `tabsetPanel()` for multiple tabs in UI

- Recommended add-on packages to Shiny
    - `shinythemes` (http://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/)
        - Easily alter the appearance of your app
    - `shinyjs` (https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs)
        - Enhance user experience in Shiny apps
    - `leaflet` (http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
        - Add interactive maps to your apps
    - `ggvis` (http://ggvis.rstudio.com/)
        - Similar to ggplot2 but plots are web-based and more interactive
    - `shinydashboard` (https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)
        - Gives you tools to create “dashboards”
