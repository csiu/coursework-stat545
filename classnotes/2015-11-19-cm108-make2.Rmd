- [outline](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/automation04_make-activity.html)

- whitespace & tabs really important in `Makefile`
- RStudio should be smart enought to know that tab in Makefile is tab (not space)
- `Rscript` is the modern way of running code in shell
- layout of Makefile
```
<target>: <prereq>
  <rule for how to make target using prereq>
```
- To run: `make <target>`

| notation | meaning |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| `$<`     | input file |
| `$@`     | output file |

- should have make clean; 2 phony rules
    - `make all` rules: how you should run make file
    - `make clean` rules: get rid all derived data (e.g. anything you can re-derive)

```
all: words.txt

clean:
	rm -f words.txt

words.txt: /usr/share/dict/words
	cp /usr/share/dict/words words.txt
```
