## Introduction
- Data visualization

    > computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of **datasets** intended to help **people** carry out some task more effectively

- Why have a human in the loop?

- visual representation
    - can use cognition for something else
    
    > replace cognitive act with perceptual act

- Why represent all the data? 
    - Why not use summary statistics? Lose of information
    - Anscombe's Quartet (identical statistics but different distribution)
 
## 4 levels of data visualization

- How to look at things? 4 Levels
    - **Domain** - target users?
    - **Abstraction** - translate of domain to vocab of vis
        - what: data abstraction
        - why: task abstraction
    - **Idiom**
        - how: visual encoding idiom, interaction idiom
    - **Algorithm** - efficient algorithm

- Why is validation difficult? different ways to get it wrong at each level

## Data types
- Types: Datasets and data
    - Tables of data
    - Network (have links)
    - Spatial data

## What and Why
### Action
- **Analyze**
    - Consume

        > Discover vs Present vs Enjoy

    - Produce
        - Annotate vs Record vs Derive (e.g. plot difference)
    - tree -> **derive** -> summarize topological structure
- **Search, query**
    - Search: lookup, browse, locate, explore
        - target known vs unknown
        - location known vs unknown
    - query: identify vs compare vs summarize

### Targets
- All data: trends vs outliers vs features 
- Network data: Topology: Paths
- Spatial data: Shape
- Attributes: One vs Many

## How do we show data?
### Visual encoding

> Marks vs Channels

- marks (geometry) vs channel (appearance)
- pick channel based on data (categorical vs continuous)
    - some channels show intrinsic order (e.g. position, size)
    - **expressiveness** matching (ordered vs unordered)
    - **effectiveness** principle - some channels we understand easier/judge more accurately

- When combine channels:

    > Separability vs Integrality 

Grouping

- Many ways to spacially arrange data
    - Arrange tables in space

- Idioms: dot chart, line chart
    - line chart = emphasis on trend
- Idioms: glyphmaps
    - rectilinear vs Radial (patterns are separate)
- Idioms: heatmap 
    - have 2 keys
    - tradeoff = scalabilty vs readability of color saturation levels
- Idioms: cluster heatmap
    - dendrogram

Arrange spatial data

- choropleth map
    - pitfall: correlation via population density (where people live not data)
- Idiom: topographic map
    - derive data from heights
- Idiom: isosurfaces, direct volumne rendering
    - surfaces of equal value
- Idiom: similarity-clustered streamlines
    - flow data
    - 3D vector field
    - metrics for line e.g. curveyness of line
    - sinks vs sources vs sadle points

Network data

- Idiom: force-directed placement
    - spring system
    - can treat as optimization problem 
    - hairball -- not able to understand data
- Idiom: ajaccency matrix view
    - transform from force-directed graph
    - tradeoff:
        - scalability: less of hairball
        - trickier to understand structure
- Idiom: radial node-link tree
    - alternate to tree
    - good for showing topological structure of tree
- Idiom: treemap
    - use of containment to show leafs
    - hard to show topological structure
    - more scalable

### Color

> Color: Luminance, saturation, hue

- luminance:
- saturation: magnitude, purity/muddiness
- hue: which color e.g. blue vs red

- System
    - RGB: poor for encoding
    - HSL: better, but beware (lightness â‰  luminance)

- Categorical color: Discriminability constraints 
    - noncontiguous small regions of color: only 6-12 bins 
    (including background color, lines, highlights)

- Ordered color: Rainbow is poor default    
    - large vs small scale structure

### Ways of handling complexity
Change over time

- Idiom: Animated transitions
    - vs jump cut

Facet (side by side comparison)

- can have same/different computing/view

- Idiom: Linked highlighting
- Idiom: bird's-eye maps
    - System: Google map
- Idiom: small multiples
    - ggplot ... disjoint data

- Overview vs Detail
- benefits: eyes vs memory
- partition into views
    - Partitioning: List alignment
    - Partitioning: Recursive subdivision
        - depends on order of partition
        - different questions

### Filtering data: reducing what is shown
- items or attributes
- aggregate 

- Idiom: boxplot
    - static aggregation
- Idiom: Dimensionality reduction for documents
    - cannot show original data directly
