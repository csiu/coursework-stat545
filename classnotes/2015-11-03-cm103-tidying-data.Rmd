## Tips of Data cleaning

0. Save the raw data
    > revoke write permission on raw files
    
1. Get data out of Excel
2. Get data into R
    - e.g. `readxl::read_excel()` to access the Excel file directly from R
    - use of `read.table()`
    - need to deal with unicode
    
    > Drop variables, create new variables, rename variables
    >
    > Drop rows
    >
    > Lead to gold:
    >     - weird character date -> proper dates
    >     - number with helpful comma e.g. 1,000 -> numbers e.g. 1000
    > 
    > Reshape data
    >
    > character into factor OR factor into character
    >
    > Replace bad data with good data or NA
    >
    > save all this intermediate data! (preferably as text)
    > 
    > Integrate data that spread out multiple files/objects; 
    > proper join/merge
    >
    > Fix data that can be rescued, Discard the rest
